# PersonalWebsite

This is a personal website to showcase my frontend software engineering skills. 

I am using this Personal Website project to put my self-taught software skills into practice. I have started this project off with HTML/CSS 
and will eventually expand my knowledge implementing JavaScript, React, Next.js, Node.js, and Firebase. 

I am currently working on deploying this site to run live on a secure web domain.

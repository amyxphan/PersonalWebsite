      <h1> Get to Know Me! </h1>
      <p class="aboutme">
      Hello! My name is Amy Phan and Iâ€™m a senior majoring in Computer Engineering 
      at the University of North Texas. Although my major focuses heavily on hardware
       engineering, I am a self-taught web/app developer interning as a software engineer
        at JPMorgan Chase & Co. As President, Co-Founder, and Regional Coordinator of the
         Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers, I'm dedicated to supporting students 
         of all backgrounds in their professional development, promoting diversity, and 
         giving back to our community. With a combination of my technical skills and a 
         deep passion for DEI, my aim is to create innovative solutions that bridge gaps 
         and drive positive change in the tech industry.

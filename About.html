      <h1> Get to Know Me! </h1>
      
      Hello! My name is Amy Phan and I'm a student majoring in
      Computer Engineering at the University of North Texas. I am the President
      and Co-Founder of the Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers at UNT (SASE UNT).
      My interest in engineering began as a little girl. Rather than playing dress up with 
      dolls, I loved to break them about and unscrew toy cars to learn how to put everything 
      back together. As I grew older I implemented these habits into my day to day life. I am
      an aspiring software engineer passionate about website and app development.

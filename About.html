      <h1> Get to Know Me! </h1>
      <p class="aboutme">
        Hello! My name is Amy Phan and I'm a senior majoring in Computer Engineering at the University of North Texas. 
        I'm currently a Software Engineering Intern at JPMorgan Chase & Co. and serve as a SASE South Regional Coordinator, 
        supporting university chapters with professional development, celebrate diversity, and giving back to the community. 
        Prior to this role, I had the honor of being the President and Co-Founder of the Society of Asian Scientists and 
        Engineers at UNT(SASE UNT), where I played a pivotal role in establishing and leading the chapter. My interest in engineering 
        began as a little girl. Rather than playing dress up with dolls, I loved to break and unscrew toy cars to learn how to put 
        everything back together. As I grew older I implemented these habits into my day-to-day life. 
        I am an aspiring software engineer, passionate about accessibility, and hope to create innovative solutions that bridge gaps 
        and drive positive change in the tech industry.
